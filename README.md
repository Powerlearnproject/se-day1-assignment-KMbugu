Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop and amintain software sytems.
It drives innovation, powrs digital infrastructure and enhances efficiency.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1940s - Birth of programming. Development of early computers.

1950s - High level languages emerge i.e creation of FORTRAN

1968 - The 'software crisis' and NATO conference. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - this inculdes feasilibility studies, risk analysis and finding the requirements.
2. Design - a solid design minimises rework by solving structural problemsbefore coding starts.
3. Implementation - this is where the vision becomes tangible
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequestial where each phase is implemented before the next whereas agile is a flexible methodology emphasizing collaboration, adaptability and delivering small increments.
Waterfall is good for a project that is well strucured with well defined checkpoints whereas agile is great for a project that promotes innovation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The software developer is responsible for designing and maintainig the software. The QA engineer is responsible for ensuring all the quality standars are met whereas the project manager ensures all the administrative and budget conditions are met. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs is a software suite that combines tools into a single cohesive interface e.g Pycharm
VCS tracks changes to code over time allowing multiple developers, correct and maintain history of a project e.g Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Keeping up with rapid technological changes. This can be solved by continous learning
2. Maintaing quality and speed. This can be solved by prioritizing critical features.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is testing individual components or modules to catch bugs at the smallest level.
Integration testing is testing interaction between combined units to ensure they work together correctly.
System testing is testing the fully integrated software as a complete system to validate it meets specified requirements..
Acceptance testing is testing to confirm the softeware meets user needs and business goals before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is generating prompts that ensure that AI gives the best response to the prompt. This improves the reponses given by AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is 'Recommend a vehicle for me to buy'. A better prompt is "which is the best car for me to buy that has great fuel consumption, is a 4*4 and has a sunroof". This narrows down the search and is specific to what you want.
